  Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and run applications
  that process vast amounts of data.

  This charm manages a dedicated client node as a place to run Hadoop-related
  jobs.  However, its main purpose is to serve as a base layer for other client
  charms, such as Spark or Zeppelin.
