description: |
  Hadoop is a software platform that lets one easily write and
  run applications that process vast amounts of data.

  This charm manages a dedicated client node as a place to
  run mapreduce jobs.  However, its main purpose is to serve as
  a base layer for other client charms, such as Gobblin or Spark.
