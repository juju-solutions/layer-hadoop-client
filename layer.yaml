      This option defines system users to be created during setup.  The value
      for this option should be a mapping of usernames to information about
      the user.  Currently, this only supports a 'groups' item that should be
      a list of groups to add the user to, with the first being the user's
      primary group.

      such as the path, permissions bits, owner, and group.  The path can
      contain references to other defined directories in the form
      '{dirs[<dir-id>]}', or to config option values in the form
      '{config[<opt-name>]}'.
